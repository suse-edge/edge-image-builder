# Edge Image Builder User Guide

## Building Images

The [Building Images Guide](./building-images.md) describes all of the possible customizations
Edge Image Builder (EIB) can apply to an image. This guide describes the necessary image definition
sections and image configuration directory structure for each configurable component and should serve
as a starting guide to new EIB users.

## Testing Images

The [Testing Guide](./testing-guide.md) provides information on how to run the customized, ready to boot (CRB)
images produced by EIB in a virtual machine.

## Debugging

The [Debugging Guide](./debugging.md) describes the log files generated during a build and where to look
in the event of a failed build. This guide also contains information on the build directory generated when
EIB runs and the files it may contain.
