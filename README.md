# Edge Image Builder (EIB)

## Building

EIB is intended to run inside a container. Some form of container build tool and runtime are needed,
such as [Podman](https://podman.io/).

Build the container (from the root of this project):
```shell
podman build -t eib:dev .
```

## Running

**NOTE:** These docs are incomplete and will be fleshed out as the project matures. At some point when it's
more mature, an example configuration directory will be added to this repository.

### Image Definition

For details on how to create the configuration artifacts needed to build an image, see the
[Building Images](docs/building-images.md) guide.

### Running EIB

The image configuration directory must be attached to the container at runtime. This serves as both the mechanism
to introduce image configuration files and provide a way to get the built image out of the container and onto
the host machine. 

The following example command attaches the directory and runs EIB:
```shell
podman run --rm -it \
-v $IMAGE_DIR:/eib eib:dev /bin/eib \
-config-file $CONFIG_FILE.yaml \
-config-dir /eib \
-build-dir /eib/_build
```

* `-v` - Used to mount a local directory (in this example, the value of $IMAGE_DIR) into the EIB container at `/eib`.
* `-config-file` - Specifies which image configuration file to build. The path to this file will be relative to
  the image configuration directory. If the configuration file is in the root of the configuration directory, simply 
  specify the name of the configuration file 
* `-config-dir` - Specifies the image configuration directory. Keep in mind that this is relative to the running
  container, so its value must match the mounted volume.
* `-build-dir` - (optional) If unspecified, EIB will use a temporary directory inside the container for
  assembling/generating the components used in the build. This may be specified to a location within the mounted
  volume to make the build artifacts available after the container completes. In this example, a directory named
  `_build` will be created in the image configuration directory and will persist after EIB finished. If it already
  exists, EIB will delete this directory at the start of a build, meaning it does not need to manually be cleaned up
  between builds.

## Testing Images
