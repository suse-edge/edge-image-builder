# Schema Validator

This tool validates an Edge Image Builder configuration file (YAML) against the generated JSON schema.

## Files

- `schema-validator.go`: The source code for the tool.
- `eib.yaml`: A sample configuration file used for testing validation.
- `go.mod` & `go.sum`: Module definitions for the validator tool.
- `Makefile`: Helper script to build and run the tool.

## Usage

You can use the provided `Makefile` to interact with the tool.

### Validate a Configuration

To run the tool and validate the `eib.yaml` file against the schema generated by the `schema-generator` tool:

```bash
make run
```

This assumes the schema file is located at `../schema-generator/schema.json`.

### Build the Binary

To compile the tool into a binary named `schema-validator`:

```bash
make build
```

### Clean

To remove the generated binary:

```bash
make clean
```

### Manual Usage
You can also run the tool manually:

```bash
go run schema-validator.go -d <path-to-yaml-file> -s <path-to-json-schema>
```

Or using long flags:

```bash
go run schema-validator.go --definition <path-to-yaml-file> --schema <path-to-json-schema>
```
